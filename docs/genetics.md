# Goat Pattern Genetics

1. The base pattern is dictated by the agouti locus
   - Controls the distribution of black-based (or dark) and tan-based (or light) areas
1. Each animal inherits one, and only one, base pattern from each parent (making a pair of genes)
1. Black is recessive
   - Both parents must carry black to produce a black kid
   - If the animal carries only one black pattern, then only the other pattern will be expressed
1. Light areas are dominant over dark areas
   - Patterns will only show dark where both inheritted patterns are dark
   - If the animal carries the gold pattern, then only gold will be expressed
1. The light color can range from white, cream, gold, tan to red (i.e. a gold pattern goat could be colored white)
1. Mutations can, although very rarely, cause patterns that neither parent carry

## Base Patterns

The pattern is determined by the Agouti locus referred to by the 'A' symbol. Each of the animals two agouti loci can be one of the following (there are possibly more, but these are the ones in existing breeding goats):

| Pattern      | Symbol | Dominance      |
| ---          | ---    | ---            |
| Gold         | A wt   | Super Dominant |
| Buckskin     | A sc   | Dominant       |
| Chamoisee    | A b    | Dominant       |
| Swiss Marked | A sm   | Dominant       |
| Cou Clair    | A pk   | Dominant       |
| Sundgau      | A t    | Dominant       |
| Bezoar       | A +    | Wild Type      |
| Caramel      | A?     | Dominant       |
| Red Cheek    | A rc   | Dominant       |
| Black        | A a    | Recessive      |

## Modifiers

Patterns and colors can inherit independent locus modifiers from each parent:
| Color/Pattern | Locus     | Symbol | Dominance | Effect |
| ---           | ---       | ---    | ---       | ---    |
| Chocolate     | Brown     | B      | Bd (dominant light/dark brown) > B+ (wild type) > Br (recessive brown) | Produces brown pigment in black areas. |
| Albino        | Chincilla | C      | ?         | Unknown in goats. May be resonsible for color dilution. |
| Muted         | Dilution  | D      | ?         | Uncertain in goats. Turns black to grey/blue and tan to cream in mammals |
| Red           | Extension | E      | Ed (black dominant) > E+ (wild type) > Er (recessive red)       | Turns black to red or yellow. 99.9% are E+E+. |
| Spotted       | Spotting  | S      | Dominant  | Produces random white spots. Can cover entire body. |

## Additional Modifiers

* Blue eyes (dominant)
* Polled (dominant)
* Moon spots (dominant)
* Roaning (dominant) - it's believed to be a partial dominant trait, but locus is unknown
* Black dominant (Ed) will override even gold (this is only known in Angora's)

# Terminology

- _Allele_ - a particular variation of a gene
- _Dominant_ - a genetic trait is considered dominant if it is expressed in an animal that only has one copy of that gene
- _Express_ - when a genetic trait produces something visible on the animal
- _Locus_ - the location of a gene
- _Loci_ - plural of locus
- _Recessive_ - a genetic trait is considered recessive if it requires both genes in order to express the trait
- _Super Dominant_ - (my term, not a technical term) a genetic trait is considered super dominant if it's a dominant trait that masks other dominant traits (e.g. gold pattern)
- _Wild Type_ - a wild type alelle is considered the normal or non-mutated variation of a gene
